# TicTacToe

A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

Players can reset the game to start a new match and continue playing as long as desired. The project serves as an example of basic game logic and GUI development using Java.
